# FoxLang Compiler

LLVM moment

thats gonna be fun

Anyway this uses premake. just run `premake5 [build env, such as gmake2 for makefiles]` after installing premake5.

## We are at the cutting edge of compiler technology

just look at this code (Also it would be cool if there was a gh style for FoxLang)

``` fox
if (true) {
ðŸ¦Šprintln("Hello World!")
}
```

there will never be any indentation arguments again!

Also if i ever make a formatter, there will be only one idomatic style.
